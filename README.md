# TheSettlers
A Unity 5.3.6f1 project implementing (most of) the game "The Settlers of Catan" for same-device multiplayer on randomly generated, arbitrarily-sized maps.

## Setup
If you're on Windows, download the Binary from the Releases page and run it. That's it.
In any other case, you'll have to install the appropriate version of Unity and build the project yourself.

*Important*: The Save/Load feature is not implemented. The buttons don't do anything.
